When you are creating a new sprint, take care of the following points from the management perspective
<!--more-->
- Planning for new sprint
    - What is the theme of the sprint?
    - Are stories allocated to specific team member? 
    - Are stories clarified (design, flow and resource)?
    - Are stories point added (review with technical lead)?
    - What is the total number of resources and hours per resources?
- Retrospective of old sprint
    - Is it successful (90% should be the target)?
    - If yes, what did you do differently in this sprint?
    - If not, why? lack of resource? lack of clarity? any urgency? 
    - If not, was it communicate during the sprint progression? What is the status of leftover stories?
