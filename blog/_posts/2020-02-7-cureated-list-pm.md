[Use this presentation to get your next Product Management job](https://iheartpm.com/use-this-presentation-to-get-your-next-product-management-job-73fe957417b4){:target="_blank"}

<div class="message">
So when you submit a resume and it comes across as a crappily displayed import in Jobvite or a plain email they need to search for companies where you worked, try to pick out names, type in URLs, go to sites or download an app you helped build.

<div class="message">
Listen, product design isn’t some innate skill one is born with, like having a good ear for distinguishing notes or possessing exceptionally powerful twitch muscles for sprinting across an Olympic stage.
