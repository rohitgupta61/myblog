Improving one's communication skill is one of the frequent questions asked on the internet. People give all sorts of advice that never really works. I found that writing a lot has helped to improve my communication a lot. It forces me to think clearly, notice gaps in my thinking, and make a coherent story.

Over time I realised that productivity is not about doing more, scheduling every minute of a day and cramming yourself. It is about doing the fewest things with utmost focus and quality. And, it will compound eventually. 

----

Focusing on one thing is a very long time keeps you in the top 1% in the world. For example, I have seen a person who is building the only Poker for multiple companies around the world for earning. But, the level of details in his approach to building a poker game is way higher. 

----

Taking complete responsibility is one of the major traits to become successful. People should leave the things on you and you should make sure that expectations should be matched at any cost and if not match, you should be answerable with specific points. 

----

Being less wrong is one of the best strategies that work for me in Investment. I always invest in instruments such as Debt Funds, Index Funds, Funds by Parag Parikh's etc that have the lowest chances of giving me a bad return in a 3-year period. Even in Crypto, I invest (3% of my investment size) in crypto such as Bitcoin, Ethereum etc which gives a lower return than others but relatively safe to invest. You can call me pessimistic but this strategy works for me. 

----

Always have a purpose of investment. One of my mentor invests 1% of the money into companies where he can potentially work. It gives him a lot of open options rather than going to the typical interview process. He invests 90% of his investment into an index fund. 

----

In spite of all the buzz, exercise is still an underrated thing. you do 10 minutes of exercise and you will increase your day by multiple hours. everyone must do it. yoga, gym, walk, etc. anything matters. 

----

Reading book is a profound impact on my brain. it gives me a new way of thinking. We need not remember any information in the book. reading book deeply is sufficient to get most of it. 

----

Communication skill is not about speaking a impeccable and polished english. It is simply what percentage of your words are understood by other person. To improve your communication skill, you need to do the following things 
- Be super prepare on a topic to speak 
- Be super focus: do less and think less 
- Do regular yoga or any other exercise to keep your energy 

----

When you are thinking about capabilities, you are most likely underestimating yourself. If you give effort to a certain skill for a longer period of time, you would be amazed to see the result. I was always thought that I would not be to type with 10 fingers but just putting 10 hours in a week made me learn this skill. 

----

When you are forming a habit, make it super easy to do. For example, if you are building a meditation habit, you plan to sit for 2-5 minutes daily instead of 1 hour. I had formed several habits such as reading (spending 10 minutes in Kindle), meditation, morning walk, etc. 

----

You must spend time thinking about what to work on. It is also a form of working. Previously, I was focused on improving my productivity by doing more but I realise that unless you are working in the right direction, there is no meaning of working hard. 

----

Habits beat everything. If you working on a new thing, it will require will power to do the work whereas once a habit is built, you won't require any willpower to do the task. And, if you have n number of such habits, the quality of your life will significantly improve. 

----

In my career, I have experienced that if you keep working in the right direction for prolong period of time, there is nothing that can stop you from achieving your goal. The key here is working hard, right direction and prolonged the period. 

----

Helping always is a long term approach. You will always get benefits back when you help a person, atleast in 50% of the cases. So, always prefer people who is helpful. It shows that they are trained to be long term thinker.

----

There is only one moment and that is now. There is no past or future. You should always remain in the current moment and this is the essence of the life. It will improve your productivity, reduce your stress and make you happy. 

----

If you are writing, start with a story. People get connected with a story that they may not connect with a normal insight. This statement is given by James Clear. All of his write upstarts with a story and give Gyan in between. 

----

We should make a decade long goal say what to achieve after 10 years and then do something daily to achieve it. I am yet to decide what is want to achieve and i think I need to start making a list and then prioritise it 

----

Rewards, monetary or nonmonetary, matter. If you incentivize wrong behaviour, wrong behaviour will spread. For example, in one of the countries, people were rewarded for killing the mouse and giving their body to the government. Soon, government realise that many people are cutting the mouse body into multiple pieces to increase the rewards. 

----

If you face any problem, instead of looking outward, looks inward. For example, if you not productive, it is easier to look outside and find a new productivity tool. Instead, you should ask is it really the tool or you are not able to focus due to some other reason? And, this is the reason, you can find a lot of early adopters in productivity tools.
