title: [Summary] Be a great product leader by Adam Nash

These are my notes from the article.

The Product Manager has only three sets of responsibilities: Strategy, Prioritization & Execution.

## 1. Product Strategy

### a. What game are we playing?

Clearly defining what game you are playing includes your vision for the product, the value you provide your customer, and your differentiated advantage over competitors.  

### b. How do we keep score?

Clearly describing the game you playing and the metrics you use to judge success allow the team, independent of the product manager, to sort through different ideas and decide which ones are worth acting on.

The result: aligned effort, better motivation, innovative ideas, and products that move the needle.

## 2. Prioritization
This is the second set of responsibilities for a product manager – ensuring that their initial work on their strategy and metrics is carried through to the phasing of projects.
The question isn’t what is the best list of ideas you can come up with for the business – the question is what are the next three things the team is going to execute on and nail.

## 3. Execution

In the end, product managers ship, and that means that product managers cover whatever gaps in the process that need to be covered.
1. Product specification
2. Edge case decisions
3. Project management
