To become more productive, I started watching youtube channels like Ali Abdaal, Thomas Frank etc who will tell you how to get more things done in a given time. I personally felt this doesn't work for me.

I achieved my productivity mantra when I read One Thing by Garry Keller. It says all great things are achieved by doing one most important things at a time. This resonated me and I implemented it in my routine.

Now, I follow the below steps 
 - Create a list of tasks to be done and give a label based on their urgency and impact. So, each task is tagged with any of the following label: UrgentHighImpact(P1), UrgentLowImpact(P2), NotUrgentHighImpact(P3) and NotUrgentLowImpact(P4). 
 - Do the highest priority task first and the others in priority orders. 
 - Review the list daily: add, edit and delete. 

**My definition of productive is getting important things done.**


I also sleep for 8 hours, wake up and sleep at the same time, do yoga in the morning and have a walk in the evening. These activities increase my energy by multiple folds.
