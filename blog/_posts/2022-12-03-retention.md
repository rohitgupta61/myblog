title: Retention 101

---



1. Social System: People are more likely to return to a game if they have a bond with other players. Give users the option to add friends, play together, send meaningful gifts, join chat groups, and more. The stronger the bond in the game, the higher the retention rate.

2. Celebrate the Return: Implement a daily reward calendar to incentives players to play daily. You can also provide exclusive content such as a new game mode on certain days of the week. 

3. Personalized PN: Utilize push notifications to create value for users. For example, you can send reminders to claim daily rewards, notify them when a friend is online, inform them about free gifts, and remind them about events and promotions in the game.



Studies ([Google](https://medium.com/googleplaydev/why-focusing-on-tomorrow-brings-back-players-in-the-long-run-e57c51bd3481), [Duolingo](https://blog.duolingo.com/growth-model-duolingo/) ) show that CURR (current user return rate) is the most effective metric for measuring retention. In simple terms, the success of a game relies on the percentage of players today who return tomorrow. Here are a few ways to increase this:

## Social System 
    - [Multiplayer] Allow users to add friends in the game. Also, send a reminder when any of my friend is playing.
    - [Multiplayer] If a user is inactive, send a PN saying your friends A, B and C are missing you. Give free chips too. 
    - [Multiplayer] Users should be able to talk with each other using chat, emoticons or voice. 
    - Allow users (i.e. friends) to compete with each other using a leaderboard of x days. 
    - Allow users to send virtual gifts to their friends.

## Celebrate the Return 
    - Give a consecutive bonus for when a user play first time during the day.
    - Provide a reason to play each day. For example, you can run Liveops everyday. 
    - Offer a free game session everyday. For example, provide free spins in slot, give free game currency day etc. 
    - [Multiplayer] Nudge users to play with in game friends with pop-ups. 

## Personalisation 
    - Show personalized sales in the game. It should be a function of my past purchasing habits and my spending pattern. For example, if I use only one currency in a multicurrency game, I should first be offered my favorite currency.
    - Run personalise Liveops to change the habit. For example, if i play for 30 minutes daily, i should be rewarded for playing 36 minutes. 
    - Experiment with several template of sales and priorities the template for a user which he likes. 
    - Use Missions or Daily Quests to 1) provide free bonus, 2) playing for longer session and 3) trying new meta games.
