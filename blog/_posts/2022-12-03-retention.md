title: CURR (Percentage of users who are coming back tomorrow)

---

Studies show that CURR (current user return rate) is the most effective metric for measuring retention. In simple terms, the success of a game relies on the percentage of players today who return tomorrow. Here are a few ways to increase this:

1. Social System: People are more likely to return to a game if they have a bond with other players. Give users the option to add friends, play together, send meaningful gifts, join chat groups, and more. The stronger the bond in the game, the higher the retention rate.
2. Celebrate the Return: Implement a daily reward calendar to incentives players to play daily. You can also provide exclusive content on certain days of the week. 
3. Personalized PN: Utilize push notifications to create value for users. For example, you can send reminders to claim daily rewards, notify them when a friend is online, inform them about free gifts, and remind them about events and promotions in the game.
