title: Retention in F2P Games	
---

Retention rate is an important metric for success in mobile gaming, and it becomes even more important as CPI (Cost Per Install) increases due to increased competition. Here are some reasons why:

**Cost**: A higher retention rate means that players are more likely to keep coming back to the game, reducing the need for expensive user acquisition campaigns. This is especially important when CPI is high, as it can be difficult to acquire new users at a reasonable cost.

**Revenue**: Players who stick around longer are more likely to spend money within the game, which can help offset the higher CPI. Retained users are also more likely to engage with in-app ads and make purchases, contributing to the game's revenue stream.

**Virality**: Retained players can also help with user acquisition by recommending the game to their friends and sharing it on social media. This can help reduce the need for expensive advertising campaigns.

## Type of Retention Rates

There are three main types of retention: short-term retention (D1, D2, D3), mid-term retention (D7-30), and long-term retention (D60+).

Short-Term Retention (D1, D2, D3): Short-term retention is typically the highest, as users are still exploring the game and deciding whether or not to continue playing. Factors that can affect short-term retention include 

1. Onboarding 
2. Game Tutorial and UI 
3. Core Gameplay Mechanics

Mid-Term Retention (D7, D15, D30): Mid-term retention is crucial for the success of a mobile game, as it represents users who have made a commitment to the game and are more likely to stick around. Factors that can affect mid-term retention include 

1. Game's Difficulty Level
2. Performance and Stability
3. Social features that encourage users to engage with other players

Long-Term Retention (D60+): Long-term retention is the most difficult to achieve, as it represents users who have been playing the game for an extended period of time. Factors that can affect long-term retention include 

1. Game's progression
2. New content and events
3. Community of players inside the Game 

Candy Crush is an example of a mobile game that achieved long-term success through high user retention. The game had D30: 25%, and D90: 10% allowing it to maintain a loyal user base that generated billions in lifetime revenue. The game's simple yet addictive gameplay and colourful graphics helped it become a viral hit, but its long-term success can be attributed to its high retention rates
