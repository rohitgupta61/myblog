### Type of Retention Rates

There are three main types of retention: short-term retention (D1, D2, D3), mid-term retention (D7-30), and long-term retention (D60+).

Short-Term Retention (D1, D2, D3): Short-term retention is typically the highest, as users are still exploring the game and deciding whether or not to continue playing. Factors that can affect short-term retention include 

1. Onboarding 
2. Game Tutorial and UI 
3. Core Gameplay Mechanics

Mid-Term Retention (D7, D15, D30): Mid-term retention is crucial for the success of a mobile game, as it represents users who have made a commitment to the game and are more likely to stick around. Factors that can affect mid-term retention include 

1. Game's Difficulty Level
2. Performance and Stability
3. Social features that encourage users to engage with other players

Long-Term Retention (D60+): Long-term retention is the most difficult to achieve, as it represents users who have been playing the game for an extended period of time. Factors that can affect long-term retention include 

1. Game's progression
2. New content and events
3. Community of players inside the Game 

Candy Crush is an example of a mobile game that achieved long-term success through high user retention. The game had D30: 25%, and D90: 10% allowing it to maintain a loyal user base that generated billions in lifetime revenue. The game's simple yet addictive gameplay and colourful graphics helped it become a viral hit, but its long-term success can be attributed to its high retention rates
