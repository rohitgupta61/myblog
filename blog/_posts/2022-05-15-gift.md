Recently, I was pondering how to select a gift for a person. Each gift should should be meaningful along with its utility. 
- So, Gift = Function (Utility, Meaning)
    - First, list down all the items which utility to the receiver,
    - Second, find out all the meaning that is associated to that person 
- Example, if a person is a male, age between 30 to 40 years and a teacher by profession
    - Utility: Clothes, Wallet, Shoes, Books, Smart phone, Laptop etc, 
    - Meaning: Discipline, Knowledge, Authoritative, Family, etc. 
    - Possible Gifts: Kindle, Watch, iPad, Formal dress or shoes, Diary etc
