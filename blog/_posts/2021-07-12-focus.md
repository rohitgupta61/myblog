As a human, we always look for fall back options to feel a sense of safely and that's why we always create plan B. But, most of the time, Plan B is the biggest reason for the failure of Plan A. Eliminating plan B brings focus to plan A.

Focus is important both in personal and professional life. For example, if you are looking for too many friends, at the end of the, you won't have any real true friends. If you are working are too many skills, you won't be able to expert in any of the skills (you may get better jobs with multiple skills). Focus helps you to allocate more resources on one particular thing. 

So, to excel in the life, do one thing: don't have plan B. Have focus on plan A.
