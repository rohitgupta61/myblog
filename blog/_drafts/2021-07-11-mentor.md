title: How to find a mentor?
---

“I’ve never found anyone who didn’t want to help me if I asked them for help. Most people never pick up the phone and call. And that’s what separates (sometimes) the people who do things from the people who just dream about them.” ~Steve Jobs 

Finding a mentor is tough. All successful people are busy working on their own projects. If you ask for mentorship, they may say no as 1) it also becomes a responsibility 2) they don't know how to help you.

We always want mentors to accelerate our growth. Mentors can help you to avoid mistakes that they have done.

Instead of asking for mentorship, I ask for help with specific questions on a topic and they will most likely to reply you.
