If the cost of planning is doing more than the cost of mistake, don't plan at all. The success metric of planning is to execute better and thus ensure better result. There is no purpose of planning except it. For example if you looking for a good food online, instead of spending hours and finding a 4.9/5 restaurant, it is good to order within minutes from decent 4.5/5 restaurant.

So why do we spend excessive amount of time in planning? There are people in an organisation who has very little understanding of the problems to be solved. So, they can't execute and show the results. To create an appearance of the work, they spend extensive time planning, which delivers no value to a customer.

We should spend an enormous amount of time where the cost of mistakes is huge e.g. military operations where the life of a soldier is at risk.
